Language Fundamentals
---------------------

1. Identifiers
2. Reserved Words
3. Data Types
4. Literals
5. Arrays
6. Types of Variables
7. var-arg methods
8. main Methods
9. command line arguments
10. Java Coding standards

-----------------------------------------------

1. Identifiers

ex:- we identify person by name
*Class Name, Method name, Variable name, label name
*A name in java program is called IDENTIFIER which can be used for identification purpose

Example:-
-----------------------------------------
class Test
{
public static void main(String...args)
{
  int x=10;
}
}
-----------------------------------------
How many no. of identifier's?

1. Test
2. main
3. String
4. args
5. x

------------------------------------------

suppose you have a kid and you have to name your kid
usually, Father sir name, god name etc.,
but we cant keep kid name as Dog, cat.,

Rules for defining java identifiers :-
-----------------------------------

A. The only allowed character in java identifiers are
   1. a to z
   2. A to Z
   3. 0 to 9
   4. $(Dollar symbol)
   5. _ (Underscore)

   if you using any other character we will get compile time error
   example:-
            total_number
            total#symbol

B. total123 is valid and
   123total is invalid
   Identifier cant start with digits

C. Java Identifiers are case sensitive ofcourse java language itself is treated  as case-sensitive programming language.
   example:-
            class Test
            {
                int number=10;  // we can differentiate wrt to case
                int Number=20;
                int NUMBER=30;
            }
D. There is no length limit for java identifiers but, it is not recommended to take too lengthy identifiers.
    In Java Identifiers max.Characters can be allowed is "THERE IS NO LENGTH LIMIT "

E. we cant use revered words as identifiers
    example:-
    int x=10; -- valid
    int if=20; -- Invalid , coz "if" is reserved key word

F. All pre-defined Java class names and Interfaces names we can use as identifiers
    example:-
    class Test
    {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int String=888;
        System.out.println(String); // Valid string is a class

        int Runnable=999;
        System.out.println(Runnable);// Valid Runnable is a interface
    }
    }

 even though it is valid but it is not a good programming practice because it reduces readability and creates confusion.

 Q1. Which of the following are valid java identifiers?
     total_number =y
     total#   = n
     123total = n
     ca$h     = y
     _$_$_$_$_ = y
     ass@hands = n
     Java2Share = y
     Integers = y
     Int = y
     int =n

 Reserved Words

 Cat is a animal
 Dog is a animal
 apple is a fruit

In Java, some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality such type of words are called Reserved words.

Reserved Words(53) divided into 2 types:-

    1. Reserved Keywords (50)
        1.1 Used Keywords (48)
        1.2 Unused keywords (2) i.e., goto and const

    2. Reserved Literals(3) i.e., true, false and null

for exam sake, all 53 reserved words should be known

Keywords for data types(8):-
-----------------------
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
7. boolean
8. char

Keywords for flow control(11):-
-------------------------
1. if
2. else
3. switch
4. case
5. default
6. while
7. do
8. for
9. break
10. continue
11. return

Keywords for modifiers(11):-
----------------------
1. public
2. private
3. protected
4. static
5. final
6. abstract
7. synchronized
8. native
9. strictfp(1.2 v)
10. transient
11. volatile

Keywords for Exception Handling(6):-
-------------------------------
1. try
2. catch
3. finally
4. throw
5. throws
6. assert(1.4 v)

Class Related Keywords(6):-
-----------------------
1. class
2. interface
3. extends
4. implements
5. package
6. import

Object Related Keywords(4):-
-----------------------
1. new
2. instanceOf
3. super
4. this

void return type Keyword - In Java, return type is mandatory, if a method won't return anything then we have to declear that method with void return type.
                           In C, return type is optional and default return type is int.

Un-Used Keywords:-
----------------
1. goto :- Usage of goto created several problems in old lanagauages and hence SUN people banned this keyword in java.
2. const :- Use Final instead of Const
 Note:- Goto and Const are un-used keywords and if we are trying to use we will get compile time error(CTE)

Reserved Literals:-
------------------
1. true and false are value for boolean data type
2. null is default value for object reference

enum (1.5 V) Keywords:-
---------------------
We can use enum to define a group of named constants
example:-

enum month
{
    jan, feb, mar, ..... ,dec
}
-------------
enum bear
{
   kf, ko, rc, fo
}
--------------------

Conclusion
-----------
1. All 53 Reserved Words in java contains only Lower-case alphabet's symbols
2. In Java, we have only "new" and there is no delete keyword in java because distruction of useless object is the responsible of garbage collector.
3. The following are new keywords in java:
    Strictfp(1.2 v)
    assert (1.4 v)
    enum( 1.5 v)
4.Valid one
    strictfp but not strictfp
    instanceof but not instanceOf
    synchronised but not synchronize
    extends but not extend
    implements but not implement
    import but not imports
    const but not constant

OCJP question
-------------
1. which of the following list contains only java reserved keyword
     new,delete
     goto,constant
     break,continue,return,exit
     final,finally,finalize
     throws,throws,thrown
     notify,notifyAll
     implements,extends,imports
     sizeof,instanceof
     instanceOf,strictFp
     byte,short,Int
     none of the above        ----- Correct answer

2. Which of the following are java reserved words
    public  ------- Correct
    static  ------- Correct
    void    ------- Correct
    main
    String
    args
