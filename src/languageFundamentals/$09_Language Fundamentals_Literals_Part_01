Language Fundamentals -- Literals Part-01
----------------------------------------


LITERAL:-
-------
1. Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal.
    Example:-
                int x = 10 ;

                where,
                        int = data type/Keyword
                        x = name of variable/identifiers
                        10 = Constant value/literal


Integral Literals:-
-----------------
1. For integral data types(byte,short,int,long), we can specify literal value in the following ways:
    a. Decimal literal/Form(base10)
       allowed digits are 0 - 9
            Example:- int x=10;

    b. Octal literal/Form(base8)
       allowed digits are 0 - 7
       literal value should be prefixed with "0"
            Example:- int x=010;

    b. Hexa-decimal literal/Form(base16)
       allowed digits are 0 - 9 and a - f
       literal value should be prefixed with "0x" or "0X"
             Example:- int x=0X10;

             Note:- For  extra digits(a - f), we can use both lower case and upper case characters. This is one of very few areas
                    where java is not case-sensitive

    These are only possible ways to specify literal value for integral data types.
